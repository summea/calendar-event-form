# calendar-event-form
A simple approach to adding Google Calendar events via a web form.

## Overview
This project allows someone to add a calendar event to a specific Google Calendar via a web-based form. Simple event location and time range checks are included in the code to help avoid overlapping events. This project was based on a request and additional ideas by M.Y.

## Requirements
- Google Apps Script

## Notes
This program was originally meant to be run on the Google Apps Script platform. Because a lot of the code is written with HTML and JavaScript, however, it might be possible to adapt this code for another environment in the future.
